      <p>The Arts and Crafts movement was an international movement in the decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and flourished in 
	     Europe and North America between about 1880 and 1920, emerging in Japan in the 1920s.</p>
      <p> It stood for traditional craftsmanship using simple forms, and often used medieval, romantic, or folk styles of decoration. 
	      It advocated economic and social reform and was essentially anti-industrial.It had a strong influence on the arts in Europe 
		  until it was displaced by Modernism in the 1930s, and its influence continued among craft makers, designers, and town planners 
		  long afterwards.</p>
